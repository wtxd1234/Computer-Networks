i) The probability that at least a single node succeeds in time slot 6 is given by the formula:

$$P(\text{success}) = N \times p \times (1-p)^{N-1}$$

Where $N$ is the number of nodes, and $p$ is the probability that a node transmits in a given time slot. In this case, $N = 4$ and $p = 0.6$. Therefore, the probability of success is:

$$P(\text{success}) = 4 \times 0.6 \times (1-0.6)^{4-1}$$

$$P(\text{success}) = 0.3456$$

This means that there is a 34.56% chance that at least one node will successfully transmit in time slot 6. The formula is derived from the fact that a successful transmission occurs when exactly one node transmits and the rest do not. The probability of this event is the product of the probability that one node transmits ($p$) and the probability that the other nodes do not transmit ($(1-p)^{N-1}$). The total probability of success is then the sum of the probabilities of this event for each node ($N \times p \times (1-p)^{N-1}$).

ii) The probability that the first successful transmission occurs in time slot 6 is given by the formula:

$$P(\text{first success}) = P(\text{failure})^{5} \times P(\text{success})$$

Where $P(\text{failure})$ is the probability that no node succeeds in a given time slot, and $P(\text{success})$ is the probability that at least one node succeeds in a given time slot. In this case, $P(\text{failure}) = 1 - P(\text{success}) = 1 - 0.3456 = 0.6544$. Therefore, the probability of the first success in time slot 6 is:

$$P(\text{first success}) = 0.6544^{5} \times 0.3456$$
$$P(\text{first success}) = 0.0518$$

This means that there is a 5.18% chance that the first successful transmission will occur in time slot 6. The formula is derived from the fact that the first success in time slot 6 requires that all previous time slots (1 to 5) have failed, and that time slot 6 has succeeded. The probability of this event is the product of the probability of failure in each time slot ($P(\text{failure})^{5}$) and the probability of success in time slot 6 ( $P(\text{success})$ ).
